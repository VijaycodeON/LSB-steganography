# Output Images

This directory contains the output images generated by the
LSB Steganography program after the encoding process.

These images are used to verify that secret data has been
successfully embedded into the original image without
visible distortion.

---

## Purpose of This Folder
- Store stego images produced by the program
- Compare original images with encoded outputs
- Validate correctness of the encoding process
- Demonstrate expected results of the algorithm

---

## Contents
- Stego images generated after embedding secret data
- Output files produced during testing and validation

The files in this directory are **program-generated outputs**
and are not meant to be edited manually.

---

## Usage Notes
- Output images should be compared with the original input images
  to observe that visual quality is preserved
- File sizes may change depending on embedded data
- Images are primarily used for functional verification

---

## Important Notes
- Deleting files from this directory does not affect the source code
- Regenerating outputs will overwrite existing files if the same
  filenames are used
- This folder exists to clearly separate generated outputs
  from source files and design documents

---

## Status
Reference output data for learning and validation purposes
